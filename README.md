## Introduction 

The internet age calls for governments to change the way they operate and disseminate information. From day to day working reports to the statistical data collected. It's important to make all these datasets public and readily available for both academic research and non governmental oversight organizations. 

In the recent times government agencies and leaders are making an effort to make all relevant data public and accessible to their citizens. In order to maximize the benefits of these efforts further correspondence with the data consumers and the government is necessary. This direct feedback when coupled with open standards, software and formats would not only revolutionize the way governments are run but also greatly augment their accountability and the citizen's ability to get the most out of their government.

## Datasets

Each of the documents on the repository tries to outline the open data requirements for one particular office/ administrative unit of the government. Each of these documents can be treated both as an requirements and open standard outline for each of the data requirements.

## Philosophy 

- Keep things simple, try to itemize everything and keep requirement and standard atomic without requiring references.
- Make branches and use 'markup' documents for all documentation.
- Create issues to propose changes to documentation structure and style.
- Keep in mind that all data should be easily consumable by computers.(be specific about metadata, markup , data depth and publishing models)
